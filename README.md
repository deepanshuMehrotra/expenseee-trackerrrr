An expense tracker is a platform where I can list all my income and expenditures from various sources like salary , freelance , food , travel , medical , education etc to make an analysis about our money. So I can have any idea where I am spending my amount.

   Steps taken during planning this project are:-

a)User Authentication to make this application accessible to multiple users.

b)Add , Edit , Delete Transactions.

c)Complete server side filtering with Mongo DB advanced queries.

d)Date and Date Range Filters to analyse the transactions in a particular period of time.

e)Analyse the transactions based on count , amount , total turnover.

f)Category wise analysis and statistics for both income and expense transactions.

g)Deploying the app to Heroku. ( Live Production Environment )
